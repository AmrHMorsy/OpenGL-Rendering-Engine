# Rendering Engine

An OpenGL rendering engine developed to support various advanced graphics rendering techniques. The engine incorporates several key features aimed at enhancing the realism and quality of the rendered scenes. 

## Features 

### Physically-Based Rendering (PBR)

Implements PBR to simulate realistic lighting and material interactions based on physically accurate models.

### Image-Based Lighting (IBL)

Utilizes environment maps captured from real-world images to provide realistic ambient lighting.

### HDR Skyboxes

Supports High Dynamic Range (HDR) images for skyboxes, enhancing the dynamic range of lighting in scenes.

### Dynamic Soft Shadows

Features the calculation of soft shadows that dynamically change with the light source position, providing more realistic shadowing effects.
