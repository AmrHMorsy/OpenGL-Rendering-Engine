# Rendering Engine

OpenGL Rendering Engine that features Physically-Based Rendering (PBR), Image-Based Lighting (IBL), HDR skyboxes, and dynamic soft shadows. The engine also leverages Tessellation shaders to dynamically refine mesh detail at runtime and anti-aliasing to reduce visual artifacts, enabling the creation of visually compelling and realistic scenes.

## Features 

### Physically-Based Rendering (PBR)

Implements PBR to simulate realistic lighting and material interactions based on physically accurate models.

### Image-Based Lighting (IBL)

Utilizes environment maps captured from real-world images to provide realistic ambient lighting.

### HDR Skyboxes

Supports High Dynamic Range (HDR) images for skyboxes, enhancing the dynamic range of lighting in scenes.

### Dynamic Soft Shadows

Features the calculation of soft shadows that dynamically change with the light source position, providing more realistic shadowing effects.
